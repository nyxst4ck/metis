"""The ledger splits its timeline at the actuals cutover: the latest imported
checking date. Everything on or before it came from imports, everything after is
forecast. The cutover date itself is the seam — an import taken that day may not
yet include a bill that posts later the same day, so an expected occurrence due
exactly on the cutover must still surface, flagged as due-but-not-yet-posted.
